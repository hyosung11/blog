# Training Inspiration Blog

  - made by Orlando Lee and HyoSung Bidol-Lee

1. Introduction
  - Since Orlando and HyoSung are both health and fitness fanatics, we decided to make a training inspiration blog with the names, images and quotes of athletes we admire.
  - The user sees images of athletes with their names and inspiring quotes. The user can add their own post with their name, an image and their words of inspiration. The user can also edit their post.

2. Explanation of the Technologies Used
  - A full CRUD app built with a React frontend and a Rails backend hosted on Heroku using a Postgres database.
  - Ruby 2.6.3, Rails 6.0.0

3. The Approach Taken
  - We drew a simple wireframe and then worked on the model and creating the routes one by one. After basic functionality worked locally, the code was pushed to heroku and the database was seeded there as well. Finally, we worked on basic styling and finishing CSS touches.

4. Unsolved Problems
  - Authentication. We would like to add the ability for users to create their own accounts. Also, we would like to create an admin who would have exclusive privileges like the ability to delete posts.

5. Notes for Future Reference
  - Maybe create an alert before the delete function happens to confirm delete.
